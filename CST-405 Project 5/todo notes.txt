t0 = 5
t1 = 8
t2 = 3 + t1 --> t2 = 3 + 8 --> t2 = 11
t3 = t0 + 11 --> t3 = 5 + 11 --> t3 = 16


TAKE TAC GENERATED CODE AND OPTIMIZE IT

Unused variables for end result -> Remove
Store variables then rather than recreate a register use the same one (look at LQ 10)

Finalize tac should not contain addition. Do that in the optimized. Current tac becomes ->
t0 = final number
print t0
